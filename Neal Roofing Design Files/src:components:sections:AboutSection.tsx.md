                <p>
                  As co-founders and childhood friends, Sam and Andrew have always
                  dreamed of creating a business that not only excels in its field
                  but also truly makes a difference in the lives of our customers.
                  Fast forward to today, and Neal Roofing is serving over 2000
                  customers per year, in the communities that we grew up in.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Our humble beginnings started with a shared vision, rooted in
                  our close bond as friends and family. We wanted to create a
                  company that we could be proud of, and that would reflect our
                  values of integrity, hard work, and commitment. We've always
                  believed that the strength of our company lies in the
                  relationships we've built, and that is why we have carefully
                  handpicked our team, inviting family and close friends to join
                  us on this incredible journey.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  As we've grown, we've also made it our mission to break the mold
                  and challenge the status quo in the roofing industry. We've
                  welcomed top talent from various sectors, embracing a diverse
                  and progressive approach to our work. By harnessing the power of
                  technology, we're continually striving to enhance our services
                  and make a real impact in the world of roofing.
